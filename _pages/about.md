I am a Senior Research Fellow in Census Innovation at the [Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/epidemiology-health-care/research/ucl-research-department-epidemiology-public-health) at [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk). I work with the [Centre for Longitudinal Study Information and User Support (CeLSIUS)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/epidemiology-health-care/research/epidemiology-and-public-health/research/health-and-social-surveys-research-group/studies-10) to support the use of [UK Census](https://www.ons.gov.uk/census) products for public good research. Before joining UCL, I completed my PhD in Social Sciences and MSc in Data Science and Analytics at [Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk), and held posts as a research officer at the [UK Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk) and the [Welsh Government](https://www.gov.wales). 


I am a quantitative social scientist with expertise in the use of **administrative data**, **spatial analysis**, and **quasi-experimental methods** for applied social research. My research interests span the social and population sciences and focus on the analysis of **neighbourhood effects**, **public policy**, and **elections**. These include:

- The impacts of local economic, environmental, and policy shocks on people and places
- The formation of individual preferences within neighbourhoods and social networks
- The spatial dimensions of social processes
