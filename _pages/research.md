Regional exposure to Chinese import competition has often been linked to support for the Leave option in the 2016 UK EU membership referendum. Looking at 143 harmonised International Territorial Level 3 (ITL3) regions covering England and Wales, and using data on the density of online social ties between them, I show that regional support for leaving the EU was also associated with exposure in socially connected regions. I first delineate 18 commuting zones based on interregional flows over three Census years. For each region, I then construct a measure of own exposure to Chinese import competition and a measure of exposure in a set of social neighbours located outside its commuting zone. Exploiting variation within commuting zones, and using an instrumental variable approach, I find that the two measures have comparable positive effects on the regional share of the Leave vote. In a series of checks, I do not find evidence that the effect of social neighboursâ€™ exposure is driven by an economic channel or a relationship between import competition and social ties. I also corroborate the regional results using survey data on vote choice. I interpret these findings as indicative of social spillovers between local labour markets: information flows from social neighbours are a likely channel behind the estimated spillover effects on voting outcomes.

<summary>Socio-Spatial Spillovers of All-Mail Voting: Evidence from North Carolina</summary>
<details><summary  style="font-size: 0.9em;color:#7B8287; margin-bottom:  5px;"><b>Abstract</b></summary>

All-mail voting has been introduced in several jurisdictions in the United States since the COVID-19 pandemic, with the resulting need for processing larger volumes of mail ballots posing challenges to election administration. Lever- aging data on more than 4.5 million eligible voters in the state of North Carolina and on online social ties between zip code tabulation areas (ZCTA) across the country, I show that local rollouts of all-mail voting also have spillover effects on choice of voting method in distant areas. Using a difference-in-differences research design, I find that an increase in the ZCTA-level share of social ties in counties that switched to all-mail voting between the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections by one standard deviation (1.77 percentage points) corresponds to an increase in the probability of casting a mail ballot by roughly 3.8 percentage points. These socio-spatial spillovers are stronger for older voters, non-Republicans, and those residing in metropolitan counties. The findings suggest that considering the aggregate social ties of a local jurisdiction in other areas may aid election officials in planning for changes in the demand for mail ballots.

<summary>The Geography of Partisan Homophily in the 2020 US Presidential Election</summary>
<details><summary  style="font-size: 0.9em;color:#7B8287; margin-bottom:  5px;"><b>Abstract</b></summary>
<blockquote style="font-size: 0.8em;color:#7B8287; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom:  5px; margin-left: 4px;">
Partisan segregation in the United States is often interpreted as evidence of limited social interaction among out-partisans, or partisan homophily. Though little is in fact known about the arrangement of voters in social space. In this chapter, I draw on data on the pairwise density of social ties between 22,537 zip code tabulation areas (ZCTA) and 2020 US presidential election results to explore the extent in which different places are socially connected to politically similar others. Using the local Moran index, I first identify clusters of ZCTAs where the is evidence of partisan homophily or heterophily. In a series of multinomial logit specifications, I then examine differences in the probability of each cluster in different settlement types and regions, and among areas with differences in the relative density and geographic distance of social ties elsewhere. In line with accounts of a segregated social space, I find that partisan homophily is the norm across areas, broadly tracking partisan segregation along the urban-rural continuum. However, the evidence is also suggestive of substantial spatial variation in the density and geographic range of co-partisan social ties: on average, homophilous Democratic-leaning areas, which are most likely to be in cities and suburbs, are much more likely than their Republican-leaning counterparts to be socially connected to distant areas.
